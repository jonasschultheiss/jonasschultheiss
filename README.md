<h3>ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Jonas Schultheiss</h3>
<div align="left">

<p align="left">
I'm a software engineer specialized in writing full stack typescript applications, preferably using Next.js and NestJS.
</p>

<p align="left">
I study computer science at FHNW in Brugg-Windisch, where I intend to pursue the DevOps specialization.
</p>

<p align="left">
In my free time I like to play around with DevOps and IaC, through which I try to build a fully declarative infrastructure to host both internal services and my own public facing projects.
